\chapter{Project management techniques for small teams and startups}

project management in the past > evolving technologies require new methods?

project management is everywhere > importance of personal pm

Benefits of understanding what is project management > education and automatisation > different approach required

\section{Project management goals for small teams and start-ups}

Problem: Software development frameworks do not include business goals. They oriented on how to build a product, but they bad at sales?

Why should startups and small-teams should be sales-oriented or problem-solving oriented, but not technology oriented at first place? 

The general goal of project management is collecting feedback in order to manage available resources to be in time. Why? -- Flow, will be considered later.

\subsection{PERT and Monte-Carlo simulation}

One of the method to collect feedback is PERT.

Statistical tool, used in PM, that is designed to analyse and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.

Monte-Carlo seeks for potential troubles and bottlenecks early.

\subsection{Teams without project managers}

Importance for collaboration software (like basecamp) to have it's own methodology and provide subtle education for its users.

The bad: hard to adopt a different methodology. No room for creativity?

The good: potentially more effective for beginners.

%
%This chapter is about communication within a team, team motivational strategies. When should a team have a project manager (or should it)? Project manager role rotation. Team members roles in the project and its relation to the notion of "Happiness".
